### Self QA

* Inspect your code in real-time to eliminate potential errors
* Indent your code to make it easy to read <!-- [Dreamweaver setup for indentation](#) -->
* Test in browser rendering for all breakpoints/liquidity
* Send Litmus test and check the result
* Test for real-devices (DSG testing emails)
* If deviating from Master Templates test your experimental code on devices as well on litmus

### Team QA

* Include all information and files to your request:
  * Litmus test (share link)

  * Subject Line and Pre-Header
  * Additional information about data, dynamics, includes

  * Tracking Links and Copy/Typos
    * Review tracking URL code and open all links; Checking copy in grammar context
